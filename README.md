# Hyprland-iso
Hyprland WM Archlinux Custom iso with Calamares installer and configuration for intel laptops (Lenovo Ideapad - mine Len16IAP 7i)
If you want to use it on different machine change the drivers packages specific for your machine in the packages.x86_64 file and ajust setup configuration
to be loaded specific for it.
The hyprland look is based on https://github.com/JaKooLit dotfiles with my personal preference adjustments.
